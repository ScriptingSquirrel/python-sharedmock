A multiprocessing-friendly Python mock object

Getting started
---------------

The ``SharedMock`` object has an interface similar to Pythonâ€™s own
``unittest.mock.Mock``. The main difference is that the state of a
``SharedMock`` object is shared among subprocesses. This allows you to
easily test interactions of subprocesses with your mock instance.

.. code:: python

    from sharedmock.mock import SharedMock

    sharedmock = SharedMock()

    subprocess = mp.Process(target=sharedmock,
                            args=('fancyArg',))
    subprocess.start()
    subprocess.join()
    subprocess.terminate()

    expected_calls = [call('fancyArg')]
    sharedmock.assert_has_calls(expected_calls,
                                same_order=False)

If the ``SharedMock`` were to be replaced by a ``unittest.mock.Mock`` in
the example above, the assertion would fail. The interaction with the
``unittest.mock.Mock`` object would not get propagated to your test
code:

.. code:: python

    E               AssertionError: Calls not found.
    E               Expected: [call('fancyArg')]
    E               Actual: []
